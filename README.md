## How to integrate into your app

Integrating the library into you app is extremely easy. A few changes in the build gradle and your all ready to use TinyDB. Make the following changes.

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```java
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency

```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.mukeshsolanki:easypreferences:<latest-version>'
}
```

## How to use the library
Okay seems like you integrated the library in your project but **how do you use it**? Well its really easy just follow the steps below.

```java
 //Create a new instance of EasyPreferences
 val prefs = EasyPreferences.defaultPrefs(this)

 //use that instance to save data
 prefs["TestKey"] = "HelloWorld"; //Save's a string value in your preferences
 prefs["Key2"] = 1; //Save's a int value in your preferences

 //use that instance to retrieve data
 val value: String? = prefs["TestKey"]; //retrives the data from preferences
 val defaultVal: Int? = prefs["Key2", 100] //retrives the data from preferences or default values if it does not exists
```
That's pretty much it. Looks like your all done here.
